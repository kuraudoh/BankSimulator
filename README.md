# Overview
Bank Simulator is a learning assignment designed to assist in teaching the developers how to code on a shared project using Git. This README.md file itself serves as a light introduction into how markdown works. For more information on markdown and its syntax, please visit [markdown.org's syntax page](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).

## Features

Bank simulator will eventually host the following features:

1. Savings accounts
1. Checking accounts
1. Creditcard accounts
1. A web ui.

## Code style

It is expected that all developers learn how to "style" their code appropriately and uniformly. We expect variables to be seperated by underscores such as below:

	i_am_a_variable = "it's true. I'm a variable."

Constants, variables which we do not want developers to change, should always be written in uppercase:

	PI = 3.14

## Git

This project will be using git as a its version control system. As such, changes to the master branch should only happen after a "pull request." Never modify the master branch directly and instead create your own feature branches.

### Happy Coding!
